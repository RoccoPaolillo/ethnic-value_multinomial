Point 1) Value-composition:
I think I was wrong, or at least other ideas are possible and have other doubts.
- Segregation means the unequal distribution in space or network of people differing along a dimension (e.g. ethnicity) with consequence 
on chance to interact. If the dimension considered is value, then conceptually segregation should be based on the two levels of
value-orientation (square and circle), spanning from 0.5 concentration (equal distribution) to 1 only one category in the neighborhood.
The behavior of intolerant agents I included could force this in the wrong direction (unless specific conditions are used).
- The point is that values as here defined is value for tolerance, and there is not tolerance which is not tolerance for something
(here ethnic diversity), which means that the two dimensions are somehow always correlated
