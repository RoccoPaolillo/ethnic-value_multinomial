Point 1) Value-composition:
I think I was wrong, or at least other ideas are possible and have other doubts.
- Segregation means the unequal distribution in space or network of people differing along a dimension (e.g. ethnicity) with consequence 
on chance to interact. If the dimension considered is value, then conceptually segregation should be based on the two levels of
value-orientation (square and circle), spanning from 0.5 concentration (equal distribution) to 1 only one category in the neighborhood.
The behavior of intolerant agents I included could force this in the wrong direction (unless specific conditions are used).
- I think it is a matter of how the dimensions of different homophily behavior interconnects. In our model we have a value-homophily
based on shared values/opinions and ethnic-homophily based on ascribed status as ethnicity (e.g. white/black as in U.S. race relation 
literature). We could have two scenarios the paper (and model) addresses:
1) the dimension that concerns ascribed status coincides  with the object of values. I think this is our case since we chose tolerance for
ethnic diversity. 
1) the dimension that concerns ascribed status does not coincides  with the object of values. I was thinking here of political parties,
e.g. in Italy where Lega, a conservative party which has negative targeted the South Italy population is receiving much appreciation 
and affiliation also by people of the Sout now that in last years trust towards politics has decreased and migrant crisis has made people
converge towards ideals of Lega. This is totally my opinion/hypothesis from my observation, but the phenomenon of Southerns shifting to Lega is real and 
documented.
Anyway need to clarify with literature and ideally what data say on how selected items would relate each other.
